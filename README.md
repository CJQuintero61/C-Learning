# C-Learning
This repo contains files to hold all my C learning projects and programs

# Resoning 
I wanted to learn C more in depth because I feel that learning it 
will increase my logical thinking skills, alogrithm skills, and the like.
I think that if I can solve something in C, then I can probably solve it
in a different language. 

I come from a C++ background where my university taught us C++ for the first
2 years, then my OOP course taught me Java, and my first programming job used
Python. In Operating Systems our programs could be in either C or C++ and 
since the professor used C, I chose to also use C instead of C++, and this 
is where my interest for learning C comes from.
